# Code snippet for selecting features in a feature class in ArcMap or ArcPro
# This is for any feature that is showing in the current map document
#Code written originally for Python 2.7, but works well in Python 3

# This is designed for CSV files
#Have a csv with the features you want to select in the first column
# Do not use column headers in your CSV

#Update the following variables:
# workspace (place where you have your CSV)
# selList (or just make sure you name your csv 'selection')
# featureClass (name of your feature class shown in the table of contents, fill in between quotes)
#field (the text/string field you want to query [name, not alias])

#originally written to select a list of parcels based on their assigned UPI (works on ArcMap parcel fabric)

import csv, os, arcpy
workspace = 'S:\FC GIS\Scripts'
selList = "selection.csv"
featureClass = r"Parcel Fabric\Parcels"
field = "Name"

#This creates a reader that makes a list based on your CSV
csvRead = open(os.path.join(workspace, selList), 'r')

with csvRead as r:
	csvList = []
	reader = csv.reader(r, delimiter = ',')
	for row in reader:
		feature = row[0]  #pulls the feature attribute from the first column in your csv
		csvList.append(feature) 
    
for x in csvList:
	selection = '"' + field + '"' + " = '" + x + "'"
	arcpy.SelectLayerByAttribute_management(featureClass, "ADD_TO_SELECTION", selection)
print("Selection Completed")

del selList, csvRead, csvList
